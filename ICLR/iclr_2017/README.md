### Conference Track - Call For Papers

The performance of machine learning methods is heavily dependent on the choice of data representation (or features) on which they 
are applied. The rapidly developing field of representation learning is concerned with questions surrounding how we can best learn 
meaningful and useful representations of data. We take a broad view of the field and include topics such as deep learning and 
feature learning, metric learning, compositional modeling, structured prediction, reinforcement learning, and issues regarding 
large-scale learning and non-convex optimization. The range of domains to which these techniques apply is also very broad, from 
vision to speech recognition, text understanding, gaming, music, etc.

 A non-exhaustive list of relevant topics:

* Unsupervised, semi-supervised, and supervised representation learning
* Representation learning for planning and reinforcement learning
* Metric learning and kernel learning
* Sparse coding and dimensionality expansion
* Hierarchical models
* Optimization for representation learning
* Learning representations of outputs or states
* Implementation issues, parallelization, software platforms, hardware
* Applications in vision, audio, speech, natural language processing, robotics, neuroscience, or any other field

The program will include keynote presentations from invited speakers, oral presentations, and posters.

### What Is Changing From ICLR 2016

1. We will use OpenReview (as opposed to CMT) for the Conference Track. Moreover, submissions will be hosted by OpenReview (no requirement to submit to arXiv).
2. We will have a two-round review process. In the first round, reviewers may only ask clarification questions.
3. The program committee will select best review awards. Corresponding reviewers will be placed in the pool for candidate ACs for ICLR 2018.
4. The [Workshop Track](http://www.iclr.cc/doku.php?id=iclr2017:workshopcfp) will favor highly innovative, but possibly not fully validated, submissions.

### Reviewing Process

1. Submissions to ICLR are uploaded on OpenReview, which enables public discussion. All comments are publicly visible (even for people who are not logged in) but the author of a comment can decide to post anonymously or not. Log in is required before posting any comment.
2. Authors are encouraged to revise their paper as many times as needed and, anytime, to participate in the discussion about their paper as well as any other paper submitted to the conference.
3. By December 2nd 2016, reviewers need to post questions for papers assigned to them. Reviews are anonymous and publicly visible in OpenReview.
4. By December 16th 2016, reviewers need to post their full review. Again, reviews are anonymous and publicly visible.
5. On February 3rd 2016, authors will be notified about the acceptance or rejection of their paper. Some of the rejected papers that distinguish themselves for their originality will be invited for presentation under the Workshop Track.
6. Papers that are not accepted to the Conference Track or presented to the Workshop track will be considered non-archival, and may be submitted elsewhere (modified or not), although the OpenReview site will maintain the reviews, the comments, and links to the versions submitted to ICLR.

### Dual Submission Policy

Submissions that are identical (or substantially similar) to versions that have been previously published, or accepted for
publication, or that have been submitted in parallel to other conferences or journals are not allowed and violate our dual
submission policy.

However, papers that cite previous related work by the authors and papers that have appeared on non-peered reviewed websites (like arXiv) or that have been presented at workshops (i.e., venues that do not have a publication proceedings) do not violate the policy.
